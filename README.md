# Random Quote Generator

A simple, interactive web application that generates random quotes at the click of a button. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this project demonstrates the use of dynamic DOM manipulation, basic animations, and responsive design principles.

## Features

- ðŸŽ² **Random Quotes:** Displays a randomly selected quote each time the button is clicked.
- ðŸ“‹ **Copy to Clipboard:** Easily copy quotes for sharing or saving.
- ðŸŽ¨ **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- ðŸ’¡ **Dynamic Styling:** Smooth animations and transitions for an enhanced user experience.



## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For structuring the application.
- **CSS:** For styling and animations.
- **JavaScript:** For logic, quote fetching, and interactivity.

## How It Works

1. A collection of quotes is stored in an array or fetched from an API.
2. When the user clicks the "Generate Quote" button, JavaScript randomly selects a quote from the array or API response.
3. The selected quote is displayed in the UI, with smooth animations enhancing the user experience.
4. Users can copy the displayed quote with a single click.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/random-quote-generator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd random-quote-generator
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the application.

## Usage
